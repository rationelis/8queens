# 8queens
This program generates and prints all valid solutions to the 8 queens problem by considering all possible permutations of the numbers 1 to 8, totaling 8! (8 factorial) permutations. If any two queens are on the same diagonal in a permutation, that permutation is not a solution to the 8 queens problem and is discarded. 

## Usage
```bash
make && ./main
```
